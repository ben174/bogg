bo.gg is an open source calorie tracker
========================================

I needed a dead simple way to log my activity and my calorie
intake.

It meant to make tracking your daily calorie intake simple.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Entering your data should be easy and dependable.
Otherwise, you won't do it.

* I'm always in the command line, I need a very quick way to say
  `bogg 350` to log that ham sandwich I had for lunch, or `bogg -400`
  to log my bike ride.

* A nice web UI to backfill data from my weekend and visualize my
  progress.

* A great, simple API so I can write my own little utilities to
  log my activity from my activity trackers, or track my weight
  from my connected scale.

* Sometimes I'd like my hand held. A nice curses application should
  guide me though backfilling data. (TODO)

Your data is *your data*, I'm happy to host it, but this is an
open source application. You can export your data at any time and
run this very simple app on your own instance.

I won't charge you anything. I build this app for myself, and am
happy to host others data since the cost of additional users is
negligible.

Uptime is critical. If this goes down, I know I'll stop using it.
As a systems architect for 15+ years, I know how to keep a site up.
You can count on this to keep running.
